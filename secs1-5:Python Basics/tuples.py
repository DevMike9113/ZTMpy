# # Tuples
# # works like a list, 
# # the difference is that it cannot be modified - immutable
# my_tuple = (1,3,2,3,4,3,5)
# print(my_tuple)
# # less flexible than a list
# # more perfomant than a list

# user={
#     (1,2): [4,5,6],
#     'greet': 'hello',
#     'age': 20
# }
# print(user[(1,2)])

# # ------------

# # Tuples 2
# x,y,z, *other = (1,2,3,4,5)
# print(other)

# # count
# # how many of the item is inside the tuple
# print(my_tuple.count(3))

# # index
# # stops at the first value that it finds
# print(my_tuple.index(3))

# # your also able to use len the same way as you use it with arrays
